Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should 
only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

CODE:
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        vector<string> words;
        stringstream ss(s);
        string word;

        // Extract words and ignore extra spaces
        while (ss >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }

        // Reverse the vector of words
        reverse(words.begin(), words.end());

        // Join them with a single space
        string result;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
            result += words[i];
            if (i != words.size() - 1) {
                result += " ";
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
