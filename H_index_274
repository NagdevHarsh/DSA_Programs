public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end()); // built-in sort

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= n - i) {
                return n - i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
