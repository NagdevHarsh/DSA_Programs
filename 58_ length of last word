Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

CODE:
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int length = 0;
        int i = s.length() - 1;

        // Skip trailing spaces
        while (i >= 0 && s[i] == ' ') {
            i--;
        }

        // Count characters in the last word
        while (i >= 0 && s[i] != ' ') {
            length++;
            i--;
        }

        return length;
    }
};

 Explanation:
Start from the end of the string.
Skip any spaces at the end.
Count the characters of the last word until you hit a space or the beginning of the string.
